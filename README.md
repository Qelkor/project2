# GhibliLand - powered by https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/ API

## OverView
A movie app created using Create-React-App. Uses a Studio Ghibli API fetched from herokuapp(https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/).

I created this app to honor Studio Ghibli as they announced their closing as of late 2021. 

I wanted to create an app that would share data of all the Stuio Ghibli films and attractions. The whole theme is based on Studio Ghibli films.
